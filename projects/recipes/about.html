      <h2>Welcome to My Egyptian Recipe Collection!</h2>
      <p>I'm Esraa Abdelmoein and I created this website to share my love for traditional Egyptian food with the world. Each recipe on this site is close to my heart, representing years of culinary tradition passed down from generation to generation.</p>

      <h3>Why I Started This Project</h3>
      <p>As someone passionate about cooking and the rich culinary culture of Egypt, I wanted to document my favorite recipes and make them accessible to others. This website features traditional dishes such as **Koshari**, **Molokhia**, **Fattah**, and many more.</p>

      <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A wide range of Egyptian dishes from appetizers to desserts.</li>
        <li>Detailed recipes with clear instructions and ingredient lists.</li>
        <li>A focus on authentic Egyptian flavors and cooking techniques.</li>
      </ul>
